### 👩‍💻 Web Developer | 🎨 Creative Enthusiast

Hi, I'm Kaye! I love tech and all things FrontEnd. With my background in Graphic Design, I am excited to continuously learn to build beautiful and accessible web apps and websites.

My tech journey took flight after completing the She Code Plus course, a transformative 6-month coding bootcamp that has been run by the lovely people at [She Codes Aus](https://shecodes.com.au). This experience opened doors, enabling me to achieve my goal of landing a job as a Web Developer.

**A few on my favorite things**: Coffee | Beach | Books | Family | Art
