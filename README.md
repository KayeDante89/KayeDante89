## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kaye! Welcome to my GitHub

I am an aspiring Web / Full-Stack Developer and I have a background as a freelance Graphic Designer.

Although I am currently working as a Retail Buyer / Assistant Manager at a bookshop, I have fallen in love with learning programming languages and have made a goal to transition into a tech career. I am actively seeking work as a Junior Developer or an internship/apprenticeship in the tech industry.
