## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kaye! Welcome to my GitHub

I am an aspiring Web / Full-Stack Developer and I have a background as a freelance Graphic Designer.

Although I am currently working as a Retail Buyer / Assistant Manager at a bookshop, I have fallen in love with learning programming languages and have made a goal to transition into a tech career. I am actively seeking work as a Junior Developer or an internship/apprenticeship in the tech industry.

## ðŸ’œ She Codes Aus

I am currently part of the She Codes Plus 2022/2023 cohort, a tech program that provides an alternative learning pathway for women to enter the tech industry. She Codes Plus is put together by the amazing people at [She Codes Aus](https://shecodes.com.au) and most of my work in GitHub are projects that I have been working on during the program.
