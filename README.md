## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

### 🌟 About Me:
Hi, I'm Kaye, a passionate creator hailing from the Philippines and currently based in Perth, WA. I have always had a profound love for the world of tech and the arts. I have a background as a Graphic Designer and love delving into various creative endeavours like calligraphy and digital art (and, hopefully, pottery one day). 

### 🚀 My Journey:
My tech journey took flight after completing the She Code Plus course, a transformative 6-month coding bootcamp that has been run by the lovely people at [She Codes Aus](https://shecodes.com.au). This experience opened doors, enabling me to achieve my goal of landing a job as a web developer. I'm incredibly grateful for the incredible women in tech who have supported me throughout this transition. Most of my work in GitHub are projects that I have been working on during the program.

### 🌸 Giving Back:
I'm committed to paying it forward. I actively contribute to the community by serving as a mentor in the She Codes one-day workshops and nurturing future talents within the She Codes Plus cohort. I believe in the power of mentorship and the importance of uplifting others in the tech industry.

Let's connect and explore the exciting realms of technology, creativity, and personal growth together. 💡
